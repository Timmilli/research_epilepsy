This gives a proof of concept about the usage of DL in epileptic anomaly detection.

However, it uses intracranial electroencephalography as images instead of MRI.

Mostly about the study of EEG with DL, it tackles a lit bit the study of MRI with DL by providing 8 linked researches.

\section{\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-024-00965-9}{Artificial intelligence in epilepsy - applications and pathways to the clinic (May 2024)}}

It tackles a lot of subjects, not only IA for epilepsy.

\section{\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378725004874}{Artificial intelligence applied to epilepsy imaging: current status and future perspectives (May 2025)}}

This reviews a lot of article on this subject.
It also explains what is the procedure

It has an interesting fact about epilepsy in France that could be reused in the report or the presentation.
